# Citizen First Person Human v0.1

Use only with the latest version of Blender.

Please read this [page](https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/Citizen_Model) and this [page](https://wiki.facepunch.com/sbox/First_Person) in order to understand better how the first_person_arms.vmdl works.

This control rig drives the already existing skeleton from the first_person_arms.vmdl file provided by [Facepunch](https://facepunch.com), meaning that it doesn't use a different skeleton and however the animation may be displayed in Blender, it will be displayed with the same accuracy in ModelDoc (that is once the twist and helper bones are configured in Blender).
